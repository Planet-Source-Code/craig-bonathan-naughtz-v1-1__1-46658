Do not use any of this code for commercial purposes. You may use it freely for personal use only.

Naughtz 1.1 is a naughts and crosses game, developed so that you can create your own boards, and even enable UFOs which take or place random pieces while playing.

This was a program that I might have issued as shareware. I developed it several years ago, probably when I was 14. I looked through all of the programs that I had made, and came across this one. So, I decided to remove the protection and release it as freeware. I will be releasing this version (without source code, and with a full install) on my business website (www.cb3software.fire-bug.co.uk), so if you like it enough, you can tell your non-programming friends about it.

Anyway, the program may or may not be slightly buggy. It has been a long time since I worked on it, but if I get enough positive feedback I might decide to develop it much more. If you encounter any problems with the program, feel free to contact me at craigthesnowman@yahoo.co.uk, or at the business e-mail - cb3software@fire-bug.co.uk

Thanks for downloading my code, and I hope you like it.
